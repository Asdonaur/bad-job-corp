# Bad Job Corporation
This was my very first game that I published ever, back in 2020.
Since I was still new in game development and the Unity Engine, the code is not very efficent.

## Important notes
- As you can see, the game is separated in two languages. They are the same Unity folder, the only difference is the language on

## What can you do with this code?
- You can download the code and run it in Unity.
- You can modify the code to make mods, and publish them to the internet, giving respective credits (Asdonaur, for creating the base game, and xDeviruchi, in case you are using the same music)
- For the music's license, you can read it in the download page from above.

## What can't you do with this code?
- You can't reupload the files in this repository or the game itself and claim them as yours.
- You can't sell anything from this repository.

Thanks for reading!
